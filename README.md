# 🛰️ Urban Website – Smart Monitoring and Service Analysis for Egypt’s New Administrative Capital

## 📌 Project Overview

**Urban Website** is a smart system designed to monitor **urban expansion**, **environmental changes**, and **public service availability** in Egypt’s **New Administrative Capital** using satellite imagery, deep learning, and interactive web-based dashboards.

The system helps city planners and decision-makers detect land use changes, evaluate development trends, and identify missing services across various regions like the New Capital, Madinty, 6th of October, and 10th of Ramadan.

## 🧠 Features

- 🛰️ **Satellite Image Analysis**  
  Use of NDVI, NDBI, and NDMI indices to track vegetation, built-up areas, and moisture levels.

- 🧠 **AI-Based Land Use Classification**  
  Deep learning models (e.g., CNN or U-Net) are used to classify land into categories: buildings, green areas, roads, desert, etc.

- 📈 **Change Detection Tool**  
  Pixel-by-pixel comparison between satellite images to detect unauthorized constructions or vegetation loss.

- 📊 **Web-Based Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built directly into the website – shows real-time visual stats and comparisons between regions with filters and maps.

- 💬 **Smart Chatbot**  
  Suggests missing services in specific blocks and helps users or planners interact with the system for insights.
